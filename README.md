# Rockfax Digital issue-tracker

# What is this?
It's a repository that we will be using for tracking issues and feature requests for rockfax digital. We're planning on building a dedicated site for all this stuff, but right now we're using this github repo. 

We don't expect our users to come here to report issues, but you're welcome to if you want!

# How do I that then?
First of all, you'll need to have a github account. Then you can go to the [issues page](https://github.com/UKClimbing/rockfax-app-issues/pulls). If you want to make a new bug report or feature request, please verify you're not duplicating an existing one.

If you're here to report an issue with the data, please visit the [issue tracker for the packages](https://github.com/UKClimbing/rockfax-digital-package-issues/issues).
